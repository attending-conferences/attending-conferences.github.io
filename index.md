# About

In this [1st GLBIO workshop](glbio24.html) will be an interactive half-day session we plan to conduct several activities in an effort to acclimate students 
who may not have attended in-person conferences
to the academic meeting environment. 
While the discussions will be geared toward first-time attendees, 
other students will be encouraged to attend not only to participate in the networking component of the session
but to help impart any experiences from previous meetings. 
This session is also intended to include students not only as participants, but as co-organizers
and continues the tradition of GLBIO being highly encouraging to junior members of our community in the region. 
We aim to attract students at the undergraduate and junior graduate level, 
though no one will be turned away.
